# Garmin Activity - Distance Normalizer
Garmin Vivofit 3 does not track correctly swimming activities. 
With this app you can edit the tcx file by inserting the correct distance and it automatically normalizes the distances and speeds of each segment. 
The edited file can then be uploaded to every activity-recording app (such as Strava).
